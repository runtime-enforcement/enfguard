The formula
 □[0s,∞) (∀x:int. (∃y:int. A(f(x:int, y:int))) ∧ B(x:int) →:R C(x:int, x:int))
is enforceable and types to
 □[0s,∞) ((∀x:int. (B(x:int) ∧ (∃y:int. A(f(x:int, y:int))) →:R (C(x:int, x:int) : Cau) : Cau)) : Cau) : Cau
However, the formula is not monitorable because the variable
 y:int
is not monitorable in
 A(f(x:int, y:int))
