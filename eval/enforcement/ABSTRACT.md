# Summary

This artifact supplements our paper "Scaling Up Proactive Enforcement", which introduces the
enforcement tool **EnfGuard**. It includes **EnfGuard**'s source code, and a Dockerfile
containing all the instructions to download the necessary dependencies to run our enforcer
**EnfGuard**. We compared **EnfGuard**'s performance with the enforcers **WhyEnf**
(Hublet et al., 2024) and **EnfPoly** (Hublet et al., 2022), and the monitor **MonPoly**
(Basin et al., 2017), which are also contained in the resulting Docker container. Lastly,
this artifact also includes the scripts to replicate the results of our empirical evaluation
presented in Section 5.
